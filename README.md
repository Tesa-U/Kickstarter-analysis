## Overview of Project: 

Louise is planning to initiate her first crowdfunding project for her theater play “Fever”. But, before jump in Louise wanted to know whether there are specific factors that make projects successful. Her original budgeting for the play is 10K and hesitant about.

### In order to help Louise to make a better decision data from the Kickstarter project campaigns are organized, filtered and visualized charts and analyzed by two categories. 

	•	Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

	•	Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Familiarizing, filtering and using accurate formulas might be challenging, however finding right resources and spending time helps tremendously. 

Two things to consider by looking at “Outcome Based on Launch Date” analysis 
	•	Theater campaigns launched during mid-April to June have higher successful rate. 
	•	Launching the project during holiday season (between Nov-Jan) has a higher chance to fail. 

Also, “Outcomes based on Goals” analysis conveys that 60% of theater projects with 10K -15K goals succeeded in the past.    


Louise also can see other findings such as which country is more likely to donate for theater play, for what goal and when (So she can start another project.) or maybe which project is more successful than the others (Is it technology projects or film projects or Publishing?)
